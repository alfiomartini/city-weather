# Abstract

This web application provides current weather information and a seven day forecast for around 15000 main cities of the world. The front-end is implemented with _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavaScript_ and _Bootstrap_, while the back-end is coded with _Python/Flask_ using _Sqlite_ as a database. As the user types in the  search input text area, a dynamically built list of cities, whose names start with the user current input text, is shown. By clicking on any list item, the user is presented with the weather information for the given city.  The database of cities is built on top of free _.csv_ files provided by [Simple Maps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities). Weather data and parameters are collected using the free APIs published  by [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api).
