This web application provides current weather information and a seven day forecast for 
most cities of the world (with at least 15000 inhabitants). The server side is implemented with
Flask, a micro web framework written in python. As the user types in the  search input text area, 
a dynamically built list of cities, whose names start with the user current input text, is shown. 
The list is built using jQuery AJAX methods. If there are more than one city with the same name, 
the user has to select the country in order to disambiguate his/her choice. After clicking the search 
button, the weather forecast html page is rendered in the same initial page. The database of cities 
and countries are comprised by free .csv files provided by datahub.io. Weather data and parameters are 
collected using the free APIs provided by openweathermap.org. The idea to implement this app came after 
reading Tristan Ganry's article "How to build a web app using Pythonâ€™s Flask and Google App Engine".
